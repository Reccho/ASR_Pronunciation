# ASR Research
### What is ASR?
**A**utomatic **S**peech **R**ecognition programs process human speech and convert it into text.
ASR programs record some speaker(s) and create an audio file of the speech it heard. The file can be cleaned and processed to reduce background noise, levle the volume, etc. The audio is then broken down and analyzed in sequences. The ASR software uses statistical probability to identify words, and then sentences. Human transcribers can improve the program's accuracy by correcting errors manually.  

#### Applications of ASR
- Live captions and transcriptions of media (usually adhering to FCC or other standards)
- Transcribing dictated notes (doctors in surgery, laboratory researchers, etc.)
- Aids for students/employees with non-standard needs (disabilities, non-native speakers, etc.)
- Court recording and other legal proceedings (digital transcription, scale)
- Many other practical applications in every field

### Noise-Robust ASR  
The goal of making automatic speech recognition technologies "noise robust" is to reduce the impact of mismatches between training and testing conditions. Since the statistics of background noise are difficult to predict, implementing noise reduction techniques should be done based on few (or none) assumptions about the noise. A noise robust technology should be insensitive to a wide range of noise disruptions. Implementing techniques to reduce noise can be done at the signal level or at deeper levels in an ASR system.
