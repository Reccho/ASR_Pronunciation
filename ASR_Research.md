# ASR Research
### What is ASR?  
**A**utomatic **S**peech **R**ecognition programs process human speech and convert it into text.
ASR programs record some speaker(s) and create an audio file of the speech it heard. The file can be cleaned and processed to reduce background noise, levle the volume, etc. The audio is then broken down and analyzed in sequences. The ASR software uses statistical probability to identify words, and then sentences. Human transcribers can improve the program's accuracy by correcting errors manually.
